## Citi Bike Trip Analysis

Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena. 

1. Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4-10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you can also merge multiple datasets
from different periods. 
2. Use your visualizations (not necessarily all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards should be accompanied by an analysis explaining why the 
phenomenon may be occuring. 
3. Create one of the following visualizations for city officials:
   * Basic: A static map that plots all the bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top. 
   * Advanced: A dynamic map that shoes how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map. 
   * The map you choose shouls also be accompanied by a write-up describing any trends that were noticed during your analysis.
   
4. Create your final presentation:
   * Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps and dashboards. 
   * Ensure your presentation is professional, logical and visually appealing. 
   
   
## Overview

New York City Citibike data from August 2019 was analyzed to show trends for times of day, days of the week, gender, starting locations and ending locations. Pandas was used to change the 'tripduration' column from an integer to a datetime datatype.
